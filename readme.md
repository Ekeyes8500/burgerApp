#Introduction

Eat-Da-Burger is a miniature full-stack web application with a custom ORM to handle requests to a MySQL database. Basically, users can enter names of new burgers to the database, and then have the option to "eat" or "uneat" the burger, updating it's data within the database.

#Features

    -Add burgers, saved and stored to a mysql database

    -Click the button to change their state of either being eaten or not

#Note to TAS

Yes, I know this app looks like hot garbage this week. A combination of this being pretty hard to wrap my head around this at first and having a lot less time to work on the homework this week has brought us here. It works though!

I plan on doing the optional homework this week of turning this into a sequelize application. I will be turning this one into my portfolio piece, and much work will be done to turn this into something worth looking at.

I'm sorry about your eyes.
